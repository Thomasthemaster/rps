# Rock Paper Scissors

A portable and fun Rock Paper Scissors Game with an I2C LCD using **a Servo and an Ultrasonic Sensor**.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

4 Green LEDs surrounding the center LED randomly flash until the center Red LED turns on. User must press pushbutton when the Red LED turns on ASAP for their real reaction time. Reaction Time is measured from when the Red LED is turned on to when the button is pressed. User then sees their reaction time on the LCD and an option to play again. The Anti-Cheat System works by checking if the button is pressed at intervals and if it is, the system will increase Cheat Score by 1 and if cheat score exceeds the threshold, cheating will be detected. The most significant feature here is compactibility, where we were able to fit many components onto one breadboard.

### Hardware
- **Development Board:** Arduino Nano
- **Main Components:** I2C LCD + Servo + Ultrasonic Sensor
- **Software:** Arduino IDE

### Cool Features
- Servo turning to random positions to represent Rock/Paper/Scissors
- Portability
- Servo turning only when hand is detected near the Ultrasonic Sensor
- Sound (buzzer)

### Wiring Diagram

Below is the wiring diagram for the project:

**Note: This wiring diagram was made in Wokwi. Since Wokwi doesn't have a Power MB V2 and some components actually differ from the actual build, the wiring diagram is an approximation of the physical build but retains the correct wiring and functionality.**

### Schematic

Below is the schematic generated in Tinkercad:

## 💡 What I Learned

I learned to make my projects more compact. Since I put this project all on **one singular breadboard**, I believe this project has challenged my ability to fit more things onto one breadboard to maximize compactness and capability. I also learned that the metal parts of the resistors must not touch each other for safety and functionality.
